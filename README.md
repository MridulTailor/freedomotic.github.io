Quick Start
======================

Follow these instructions if you want to compile Freedomotic from source (eg: to develop your own plugins). If you just want to try it, just download the precompiled binaries you can find at the official download page https://sourceforge.net/projects/freedomotic/

**1) Fork Freedomotic on GitHub**

* Create an account on https://github.com if you don't have one.
* **Fork Freedomotic** [_(What does it mean?)_](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) following this link: <https://github.com/freedomotic/freedomotic/fork>. 
* Create the local clone of your online fork with this command:

```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/freedomotic.git
```

Now the repository is ready to work with.

**2) Enter the new local folder**

    cd freedomotic
    
**3) Compile Freedomotic with maven**

    mvn clean install
    
**4) IMPORTANT!!!! THIS IS REQUIRED: Copy the example-data folder into freedomotic-core/data.** If you miss this step Freedomotic won't start

    cp -r data-example/ framework/freedomotic-core/data
    
**5) Run Freedomotic**

    java -jar framework/freedomotic-core/target/freedomotic-core/freedomotic.jar

As an alternative you can start **freedomotic-core** project from your favourite IDE.
